However, for some use cases such as audits and security checks, completeness of results are far more important. Search Jobs allow search queries to be run across your entire codebase (including repos, branches, and revisions) at scale and prioritize completeness over quick response times and results ranking.\n\nIn beta and available by default since Sourcegraph 5.3, weâ€™re happy to announce that Search Jobs are now generally available.
